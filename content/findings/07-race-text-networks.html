<h2>Social Networks with Unionized Terminology</h2>
<p>Something that is important to us is soldiers' dicussions of inner-outer groups of people. A way that we decided to look at that was by unionizing biterms. For example, a naive co-occurence with &quot;black&quot; may be &quot;people&quot; but we care about the dicussion of &quot;black people&quot; rather than just the identification of &quot;people&quot; as co-occurring with the word &quot;black&quot;. To do this we complete several unionizations of biterms to create co-occurrence networks of dicussions of groups of people.</p>
<div id="long-responses" class="section level3">
<h3>Long Responses</h3>
<p>We complete unionized term co-occurences and social networks using long response textual data. We separate our analysis by race and report co-occurences and co-occurence networks for both black and white soldiers.</p>

<div id="short-responses" class="section level3">
<h3>Short Responses</h3>
<p>We complete the same unionized-analysis above but using only short-response data from white soldiers. We are unable to get enough data to create plots for the two different groups of white soldiers: pro-segregation and anti-segregation. The following analysis reflects terms used in the entire group of white soldiers.</p>

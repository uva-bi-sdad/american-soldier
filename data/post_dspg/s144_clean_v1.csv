It is quite obvious, that the Southern boys in the Service resents the northern boy and vice versa therefore there will always be that constant friction between the two. I also believe that White Officers resent commanding negro troops and a lot of negro troops resent White Officers. Why not have negro troops commanded by Negro Officers, the same for the White soldiers. Give them their very people to command them. Once that feeling of prejudiceness and Race Hatred is broken down I feel quite confident that the whole country as a whole will be a better place to live in. "

One can always tell when prosperity is around for that's the time the Repub. come in and the Dem. go out which seems in the process of happening now. Possibly in the next eight or ten years there will be another depression. The harbinger of this is usually the outbreaking of disturbances in the European countries as well as the Asiatic. It's because of these things which seem bound to happen that some powerful organ should be set up with full powers to rule over such disturbances until this part of the business cycle is past. I believe this for when people are happy with prosperity and are busy taking in the revenues they have not the time nor the state of mind to enter disturbances. "

Mabe it compulsory for the Southern states to educate negros. I believe the only way to promote good feeling and trust between the white and black race is thru education. It is an insult to the intelligent negro to be put in the Service commission of the PM. Corps, labor battallions etc. In order for the Army to procure better morale it should abolish this practice.

At present I'm of the opinion that none of us are justified by serving outside the limits of the United States. As I see it, the fight with Germany is fundamentally for the preservation of Democracy. Democracy is a principle never fully realized by us. Many have been denied the right of popular vote which is the basis of democracy. Discriminative conditions present themselves all over the country. So our present fight for democracy is sort of ridiculous.  In fighting Japan the main issue seems to be, ""The maintenance of white supremacy"" Again that is, to me, a ridiculous objective. I'm of the opinion no man, regardless of color, is superior to me or in prospective to my race. That is probably the main reason of the discrimination shows my race by the ""White America"". They are aware we are socially, mentally, physically and spiritually their equals or better.

We are all on this earth together and I can't see why we have to be separated from each other and expect to have full cooperation.

There are towns in this state, Texas, in which I cannot even go to pick up a telegram or cash a money order. Yet right here I have just completed with my unit the satisfactory passing of tests that have shown us qualified as soldiers who can effectively fight and die for the perseverance of social equality with liberty and justice for all. Come now the army can at least clean up its own back yard. Moreover the nation should back the rights it gives to man through the supreme court. (meaning voting privilege) Its a laugh and don't think it isn't a  nazi  background for Hitler propaganda. "

That for our part is swell. But it makes some predjudiced whites more determined than ever to get the negroe back in his so called place! So long as the war continues and the demand for war materials keep industry on the go, the more upgrading will go on. I see this war as a temporary good thing for so many underprivileged negroe people, and at the end of the war I foresee bloodshed in America in the form of race riots. Negroes who have gained prosperity in Civilian life, and gained the experience of fighting for America will not will not peacefully let the American fascists put him back in what they call his place. It would be a great help to the winning of the ""Peace"" if the Army would encourage better race relationships by educating the whites to the actual truth about negroes! No intelligent negroe can see himself inferior to any man because of color. 90% of our people can [underline]willfully[/underline] live in harmony with any race, compared to about 20% of whites that can or will for the sake of a country without a conscience!!! Since I have been in the Army, at least three times I have come close to  losing my life on this side of the water, because I wont stand for one of the superior race to abuse me vocally or physically. There have been numerous cases of soldiers getting killed because their government offered them no protection because of their color. Very few large papers publish these gruesome facts, but if the General Public would read the ""Chicago Defender"", The Pittsburgh Courier"" they would be thoroughly informed about the disgusting things that are happening  to the saviors of America, and things that will open their eyes to many  truths really worth while knowing. It should be keep in mind that we are fighting to defeat the [insertion] so called [/insertion] superior races, not to develop them at home. The army has done one good thing if nothing else. It has given a lot of whites a chance to hobnob with some intelligent negroes, and convinced them that we  aren't freaks!  "

If this is not possible, which I am sure it is, why not equalize things by placing colored officers in charge of otherwise all white companies? It appears to me that the army doubts the ability of colored leaders for some reason. Wouldn't it stand to reason that a colored officer would understand the colored man better than the white officer would and because of his better understand would produce better soldiers? Another thing I have noticed is that the army seems rather reluctant in letting any colored into the medical department. All of the general hospital units hospital train units etc. are composed of white troops. Why is this? Does the army think the colored man lacks the learning capacity of a white man? It has been proved again and again that if the colored man is given the same training and education as a white man for a particular job he can do the job just as efficiently as the white man. "

There I was subjected to discrimination, segregation and prejudice. I found that a negro soldier in the uniform of the United States meant no more to the bigots of the South than a dog meant. On the army post itself, I found in the Quartermaster's laundry the old familiar signs over the water fountain ""For white only"". In the post theatre I found the negro soldiers boxes over in one corner of the theatre with all other sections reserved for white soldiers. While on barracks I found that there were separate cars for Negro and white soldiers to work their mens equipment. I could go on naming the endless humiliation the negro soldier has been subjected to I could mention the opponent designs of the Army to name and put in power ignorent [ignorant] and illiterate non commissioned officers who cannot even read nor write, because it is this calibre [caliber] of negro soldier who does not question the disgraceful treatment accorded the Negro soldier.  I don't feel that there is a great deal of difference between the American type of fascism the negro soldier has been subjected to in this country and the type we are fighting to destroy in Europe. I feel that there are many reactionaries in this country who would rather destroy the Negro and break his will than to  destroy Germany and Japan. I feel that it is wrong to have a Jim Crow Army. Fascism is fascism, whether in America or in Europe and If we are all fighting for the same common purpose why must there be a White Army and Negro Army.

The axis soldier knows what he is fighting for but can you find many American soldiers who can truly say the are fighting for any special purpose? The army doesn't emphasis unity??? to make a good fighting team but are influence to carry out prejudices practise by ignorant leaders in politics scatter throughout the country. I am hoping that after the war people will be brought closer together in human relationships and don't have to wait until the next war to allow various groups in the country to maintain jobs they are qualify to do in peace time, but have to wait for war to show their worth.

By the time these troops return, most of the best jobs will be occupied by the white veterans.

Unless every american has an equal right to the four freedoms, we defeat our purpose for a real democracy, and mens lives will have been lost in vain.  In order to maintain our high standard of living, economic conditions must be considered for the masses. It is difficult to make plans for your life after the war, unless you can feel sure that there will be no discrimination in the governments post war policies.  I am an american soldier. I pledged my life if necessary to defend my country. After the war I will expect the same opportunities for post war living as the next american. If our democracy is to be made real, if our constitution is to become a reality rather than a historical document, I have no fear for obtaining security under post war conditions. So far the army hasn't given equal opportunities to its soldiers regardless to race, creed, or color.  "

Flag waving and the person that waves the flag is the first one to holler ""niggers in the rear"". I don't think the Negroes should start a war over here to gain all their rights but those people that believe in Democracy would become better organized and advocate those that fell for Hitler stooges over here (Henry Ford, Pew, Dupont, Martin Dies, Fish, Dewey, Hoover, Hearst, McCormick etc.) because there are the fellows that furnish the govt propaganda, etc. to carry on race riots, cause confusion, etc. There are the guys that ought to be lined up and shot because (over) they are the ones who found the would be Hitlers over here like Gerald L.K. Smith, Father Coughlin, K.K.K. Silver Shirts Drew (N.Y.)

The wanton discriminatory acts of cruelty and injustice heaped on the families of American Soldiers (Negro) and even sometimes on soldiers themselves makes the spirit of the Negro very low indeed. It is impossible to have good spirit and be willing to give all for a cause that you and your family will not have the priviledge of enjoying. The obvious indifference, hypocrisy, injustice and race baiting by our ""Honorable"" public officials from the south simply infuriates me. The placing of obviously inferior men in positions of authority over more competent men because of color or race is rampant in the Armed forces (another cause of frustrated anger and low spirits). We are fighting (we are told) to give liberty and freedom to all people. This is the exact opposite of the truth in the case of the American Negro. Many criminals are simply proud men who refuse to bow to ""Jim Crow."" I hate Hitler, and all he stands for but there are those among us who advocate the same principles of a so called ""Master Race"" right here in the United States, ""the champion of suppressed people."" I think strong, positive measures should be taken to protect all minorities and assure them of what the Constitution is supposed to give them. There should be at least a glimmer of light to keep hopes and ideals alive.

I'm satisfied with what I'm doing now, but it is really disappointing to be faithfully promised something and you set your mind on it and yet it doesn't come through. If I could have gotten enough training n radio during my stay in the Army I would probably go into that field after the war. "

Servicemen expect, should have, and will have employment after the war. However if this is achieved at the expense of others, who through no fault of their own, did not serve in the Armed Forces - a cleavage between both groups will result and the possible outcome may be disastrous. Full employment will tend to give all a feeling of security, and make  the better competition for jobs, which brings about the intensification of moral and religious bias. A comprehensive plan now, will go a long way to allow the fear and suspicions about post-war employment opportunities.  "

That is because the army doesn't take them unless they are mentally qualified and secondly we have just experienced this huge army for the first time in history. Therefore we or I expect  mistakes but as a whole it is being handled very fair & the best of military and ability. And I am for at least one year's training for young men after the war, and they can be corrected by the mistakes made in the past years of them or this present war. Because I personally believed & have study history which shows, we & the world to have one just about every 20 years. Therefore I will be old then & won't have to do what my parents are doing today.

I had reached the conclusion that the Bill of Rights is practically a farce because it has been used  shamlly  & unscrupiously by the high rulers of the U.S.A.  I also feel that blood will be spilled & lives lost after this war, within this country because of men being refused the rights they fought for in the present conflict. I for one feel that there are principles & rights I would feel proud to die for knowing that the ancestors of my race & time profited by my death & its cause. I believe that my race has awakened & fully realize that something worth fighting for is worth having. We have learned to fight the intelligent way & what we should fight for.

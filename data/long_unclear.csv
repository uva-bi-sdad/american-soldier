"as a soldier in the armed forces i think that every soldier should be made to feel that he is the best damn soldier in the world. the army should protect all of its soldiers and see to it that they aren't mistreated. they should be given a chance according to thier abilities regardless to color. when a soldier is made to feel he is inferior he lacks the efficcancy to perform his task which he should have.  there is a reluctance on the part of the officials of the war dept to allow certain soldiers (negro) to get much of a chance in the air corps & other units. there are only a few tanks units (two). its not because these soldiers aren't proficient in these branches. its a false conception on the part of the higher ups. men should be graded by character and ability and place accordingly. and not held and restricted mostly to certain units. to me the average white soldier (enlisted) man is prejudiced, because he knows we are all got to cooperated in order to bring this war to a successful conclusion. the false theory that white and negro soldiers can't get along to-gether is absolutely false. in certain places they have prooven it such. it can be done everywhere else. i don't mind going over seas to help smack the axis and help make the world safe for democracy but i certainly would like to see certain places in this country made safe for certain minorities. the whites especially from the south are very unwilling to give every citizen a chance to work and fight as they desire. what is a  handicap to people who are absolutely patriotic, and willing to sacrifice as everyone else does. its [unclear]bad[/unclear] on the morale of the negro american soldier.",black,507,[unclear]bad[/unclear],bad

negroes were mentioned in the questions but the question of racial prejudice in general was not touched. it is as important as the negro question. i think that an intelligent person would find many of the choices to a question not quite expressing his opinion withoot [without] added comment. bus service is mentioned but nothing is mentioned about train travel. no doubt many camps are convenient to rail connections. i doubt if there are many soldiers in the present army outside of commission ed specialists are getting any training that will be of particular value in civilian life after the war. it would have been a good idea to include a question or two on whether or not a soldier felt he was getting good training for his special duty in the army. my contacts with negroes have been superficial. but i believe it best to keep them separate. negroes were mentioned in the questions but the question of racial prejudice in general was not touched. it is as important as the negro question. i think that an intelligent person would find many of the choices to a question not quite expressing his opinion without added comment. bus service is mentioned but nothing is mentioned about train travel. no doubt many camps are[unclear]connected?[/unclear]to rail connections. i doubt if there are many soldiers in the present army outside of commission ed specialist are getting any training that will be of particular value in civilian life after the war. it would have been a good idea to include a question or two on whether or not a soldier felt he was getting food training for his special duty in the army.,white,5340,[unclear]connected?[/unclear],connected
(this is my honest opinion of this [unclear]coruption[/unclear]) first the men were not given a chance at the induction center. phisical or mental examinations were not closely given. when in the army if you don't fit in with the non-come or officers you won't get anywhere. when you see you can do a better job in another branch of service or company they won't listen to you when you ask to be changed. the meals and excersise are not properly given. the extra details are not necessary in many cases. i also can see many jewish boys still hanging around the corners in civilian life whereas their location should be in the army and the few that are in holds the best jobs. there is a lot of underhand work going on which must be stoped or will end up in a personal war in this country.,white,5347,[unclear]coruption[/unclear],corruption

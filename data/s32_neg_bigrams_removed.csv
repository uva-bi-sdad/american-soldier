"524",527,"the most irritating part to me about the army training i have received is this: since leaving induction center i have been continuously moved deeper and deeper into the heart of the south and conditions and the attitudes of the people also have been growing worse. it is impossible to understand how the brains of the southern white man works and just what can be the cause of so much enmity and hate that is imposed upon the negro soldier. with all the patriotic speeches and supposedly war effort he takes time out to heap insults and abuse upon the negro soldier who is doing all that he can to further the war effort. this energy could be well used to further the defeat of the enemy. to my mind most southern white people must fear that the rise of the negro will be of danger to their long vaunted white supremacy. there can be  reason for such stupid treatment of a fellow american. stupidity as we all know breeds ""fear"". (over) this unrest among the forces of the united states can in the long run be a leading factor to the lengthening of this war. for as the saying goes a house or an army divided against itself will surely fall, hitler knows this better than we may think. in my mind, judging from the average opinion of most of the negro soldiers that i have met; it would be of great value if they were trained in a more friendly environment. a soldier can  his entire mind and body to the very necessary training under such adverse conditions as we in the south are forced to undergo.","black_long",NA

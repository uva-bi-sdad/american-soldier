The questions and responses are mostly geared towards WACs, which are Women&#39;s Army Corps members. In addition to survey 32, which captures textual data on gender in teh Army, a survey was given out in January of 1945 to capture perspectives of male soldiers on their WAC counterparts.</description>

In addition to analyzing race relations between soldiers, we want to see how gender roles were discussed amongst soldiers. Our particular focus is on women&#39;s gender roles during the time of 1943 and at the intersection of race relations.</description>
